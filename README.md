## Overview

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is a VPN service that creates a private and secure network between your devices.

This add-on integrates Tailscale into your [DDEV](https://ddev.com) project. Unlike temporary sharing solutions, this gives you permanent, human-readable URLs that work across all your Tailscale-connected devices.

Read the full blog post: [Tailscale for DDEV: Simple and Secure Project Sharing](https://ddev.com/blog/tailscale-router-ddev-addon/)

## Use Cases

This add-on is particularly useful for:

- **Cross-device testing**: Test your sites on phones, tablets, or other devices without being on the same Wi-Fi network
- **Stable webhook URLs**: Use permanent Tailscale URLs as reliable endpoints for webhooks from payment gateways, APIs, etc.
- **Team collaboration**: Share your development environment with team members to show work in progress
- **Remote development**: Access your local development sites securely from anywhere

## Prerequisites

Before installing the add-on:

1. [Install Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on any two devices (computer, phone, or tablet). This is required to generate the auth key.
2. [Enable HTTPS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https) in your [DNS settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) by clicking "Enable HTTPS..." (required for TLS certificate generation).
3. [Generate an auth key](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys) in your [Keys settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) (ephemeral, reusable keys are recommended).

    Get the auth key and add it to your environment by updating `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or another relevant shell configuration file with this command:

    ```bash
    echo 'export TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-your-key-here' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Alternatively, you can also set up authentication using `ddev tailscale login` after your project starts. This provides secure, interactive access for your DDEV project.


4. **For public access**: To enable Funnel (public sharing), configure your [Access Control List (ACL)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel#funnel-node-attribute) in the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls) by adding the `funnel` node attribute:

    ```json
    {
      "nodeAttrs": [
        {
          "target": ["*"],
          "attr": ["funnel"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

5. **For SSL certificate generation** (Optional): To run the command `tailscale cert` from the container, the machine needs corresponsing access by adding a `certs` capability inside node attributes: 
    
    ```json
    "nodeAttrs": [
      {
        "target": ["*"],
        "attr":   ["tailscale.com/cap/certs"],
      },
    ],
    ```

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get atj4me/ddev-tailscale-router
ddev restart
```


To launch your project's Tailscale URL in your browser:
```bash
ddev tailscale launch
```

To get your project's Tailscale URL:
```bash
ddev tailscale url
```


Your project's permanent Tailscale URL will look like: `https://<project-name>.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`. You can also find it in your [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).

### Configure Privacy (Optional)


By default, the project doesn't connect to Tailscale. To start sharing with your tailnet: 

`ddev tailscale share`

To make your project publicly accessible (Funnel mode):

```bash
ddev tailscale share --public
```

To revert to private mode (only accessible to your Tailscale devices):

```bash
ddev tailscale share
```

### Authentication Persistence

Authentication is stored in the project's `tailscale-router-state` Docker volume and persists across DDEV restarts. Treat that volume as sensitive because it contains the project's Tailscale node identity.

To revoke the identity manually before deleting or archiving a project:

```bash
ddev tailscale logout
```

To log out automatically whenever the project stops, set `TS_LOGOUT_ON_STOP=true` before starting DDEV. Persistent authentication is the default so normal restarts do not create a new Tailscale node.

## Usage

Access all [Tailscale CLI](https://tailscale.com/kb/1080/cli) commands plus helpful shortcuts:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `ddev tailscale launch [--public]` | Share and launch your project's Tailscale URL in your browser (`--public` uses Funnel mode for public access) |
| `ddev tailscale share [--public] [--port=<port>]` | Start sharing your project (`--public` uses Funnel mode for public access, `--port` sets the local port) |
| `ddev tailscale stop` | Stop sharing and reset proxy/funnel configuration |
| `ddev tailscale stat` | Show Tailscale status for self and active peers |
| `ddev tailscale proxystat` | Show Funnel/Serve (proxy) status |
| `ddev tailscale url` | Get your project's Tailscale URL |
| `ddev tailscale login` | Authenticate with Tailscale |
| `ddev tailscale <any tailscale command>` | Run any Tailscale CLI command in the web container |

**Notes:**
- The add-on proxies port `80` inside the DDEV web container by default. `DDEV_ROUTER_HTTP_PORT` is a host-side router port and is intentionally not used. To expose another service in the web container, add `--port=<port number>`. Example: `ddev tailscale share --port=8025 --public` exposes Mailpit. Only ports inside the `web` service are supported.
- The script now checks authentication before running commands and provides clearer error messages and guidance for login.
- Proxy/funnel status and reset are handled automatically to avoid port conflicts and stale configurations.

## Advanced Commands


[Tailscale Serve](https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve) and [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1311/tailscale-funnel) commands can be used to serve custom ports or files on your TailNet Server. Run `ddev tailscale stop` first to reset any existing proxy/funnel configuration, if you want to reuse the same port.

```bash
# To serve a ReactJS application running on port 8443
ddev tailscale serve --bg --https=8443 localhost:5173
```
This will share the main project in the `443` port and have the React app in a different `8443` port. 

Only ports `8443`, `443`, and `10000` are supported by `tailscale funnel`. 


## Troubleshooting


If you get an error while running the share command, check your authentication status:
- Make sure your `TS_AUTHKEY` environment variable is set and valid.
- Run `ddev tailscale login` to authenticate interactively if needed.
- If you encounter port conflicts or stale proxy/funnel handlers, the script will attempt to reset and retry automatically.
If problems persist, try logging out using `ddev tailscale logout` and then rerun your command (`ddev tailscale share`, `ddev tailscale launch`, or your custom command).

If HTTPS has a valid certificate but returns `502`, recreate Serve with the web container's HTTP port:

```bash
ddev tailscale share --port=80
```
